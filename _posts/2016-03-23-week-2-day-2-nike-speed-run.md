This is a 800m + 3x400m + 400m recovery + 800m + 3x400m + 400m recovery.

I modified it to run  1200m to finish off the 5K.

On the run home, felt super heavy legs and carb depleted. I actually had to start walking about half way through. Notice the big dip. The positive news is that I got a bit of second wind. I guess I found some extra carbs or fat to breakdown.

The other thing I worried about was the rain and weather. Do I need a jacket? My Nike one held up OK. It's just not reflective on the way home.
