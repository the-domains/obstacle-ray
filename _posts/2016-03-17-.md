This workout is about simulating obstacle racing with an emphasis on pushing pace after an incline. Sometimes, I do obstacles at both the top and bottom of the inclines. Today, I just did a monkey bar traverse at the top.

This is because I'm doing a total of 1040 meters of bucket carry at the beginning and end of the workout.

I just wish that there was more of an incline on the climb.
