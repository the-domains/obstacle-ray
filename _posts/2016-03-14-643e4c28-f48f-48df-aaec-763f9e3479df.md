I usually do this run in 38 minutes, but coming off of a flu, this is kind of expected. I had lots of trouble between 6-8KM. I've never really felt where my lungs couldn't keep up with my legs. It's usually the other way around. The rain, wind, and puddles didn't help, but that wasn't the main issue.
