The intervals were not easy. You worked with a partner.

## Interval 1 (8 minutes):

Partner: sits in a squat

You: bear crawl, burpee, bear crawl, push up.

Switch and repeat.

## Interval 2a (4 minutes):

Partner: high plank

You: push-ups

Switch and repeat.

## Interval 2b (4 minutes):

Partner: squat

You: 5 squat jumps

Switch and repeat.

## Interval 3 (8 minutes):

Partner: jumping jacks

You: big tire flips, tire jumps, chain pull, sledgehammer

Switch and repeat.

## Obstacles: 

A-frame monkey bars, rope climb, inverted wall.

Learned about the foot hook technique to save energy on the inverted wall. Awesome!
