I am running a couple of 25KM trail races. I've never run that distance before. So I've made a point to not only practice the distance, but also the trail.

It would be amazing to run an average of 4min/km, but given that I'm at 5:13min/km, that might be unrealistic. With about 600m of elevation, 4:30min/km would be more achievable.
