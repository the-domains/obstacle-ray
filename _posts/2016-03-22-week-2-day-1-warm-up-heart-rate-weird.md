description: "I had to switch my schedule around because of the bad weather coming up in Toronto this week. After my 25KM, I put a tempo run. During my warm-up, my heart rate spiked to 165, then went down even on an easy 5min/km pace. It may mean I'm tired."

I felt like I couldn't push the pace. The good news was that my lungs were good, but felt my legs couldn't extend the stride as much. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/298118e3-08da-4a37-9bd2-c87426d55127.png)
