## Improvements for Obstacle Training

## Running volume seems low. 

Perhaps with the mix of the strength training, the volume will seem OK. I'm not an elite runner, but I feel like this volume might be OK for races 10-15KM max, but not longer.

# No nutritional info

This is the biggest area for improvement for me. Perhaps I'll need to take to the forums.
