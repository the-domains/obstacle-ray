Phase 1 strength looks has:

* Reverse lunge
* lateral lunge
* dips
* rows
* step up
* side plank
* calf raise
* wall sit.

Multiple sets each with 3 total rounds. I think this takes a bit too long. I did one set modified with 35lb weights and it took me 50 minutes to get through with 30 seconds rest.
