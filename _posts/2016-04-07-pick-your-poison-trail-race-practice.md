I'm running the Pick Your Poison 25KM trail race on April 30th. I went for my first test lap in the snow covered trail. The climbs are quite significant with about 400m for each 12.5KM lap. The trails are a bit covered so it's hard to find. I just did one lap, then hill repeats. The panorama shot looks beautiful.
